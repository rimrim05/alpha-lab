# Target-free subspace-averaging min-var (EXP-2026-07-14-subspace-averaging)

Σ = λ̄P̄ + δ̂²(I−P̄); P̄ = top-k eigenspace of the mean of the last L monthly PCA projectors (extrinsic RSS). Matched pair vs single-window (L=1), unconstrained min-var, paired monthly realized vol. Decisive cell: small-cap n=63 k=5. Prereg: preregistrations/subspace-averaging-2026-07-14.md.

## Decisive cell (small-cap, n_est=63, k=5)

- L-curve (median relative realized-vol Δ vs L=1): L=3: -3.00% (p=0.492), L=6: -2.61% (p=0.466), L=12: -4.09% (p=0.130)
- best L = 12 (-4.09%, p=0.130); subspace stability (k-th eig of M, L=12 median): 0.305

## Verdict (pre-committed rule, decisive cell): **NO EFFECT**

## Story (the broader table is decisive, and it kills pure averaging)

- **Decisive cell: NO EFFECT.** small-cap n=63 k=5 point estimates favor averaging (−3 to −4% vol) but none clears p<0.05 (best p=0.13), underpowered, and against the uniform pattern below it's most consistent with noise (it's the single noisiest cell: small-cap, short window, most factors).
- **Everywhere else, averaging HURTS, significantly, and the stability diagnostic explains exactly when.** The k-th eigenvalue of the mean projector M measures subspace agreement across months: ~1 = windows agree, low = they disagree. Where the subspace is STABLE (stab→0.9-0.98: k=1, or n=252) averaging is ~neutral. Where it's UNSTABLE (stab 0.30-0.45: the short-window multi-factor cells) averaging is significantly WORSE, and worse with larger L (large-cap k=3, L=12: +14.6% vol, p<0.001; k=5 +4.7%, p=0.004).
- **Mechanism, cleanly diagnosed: the subspace disagreement is DRIFT, not sampling noise.** Low stability means the factor structure genuinely changes month to month; averaging can't tell drift from noise, so it blurs drifted subspaces into a stale estimate that fits next month worse. This is the exact failure mode the prereg pre-stated, averaging reduces variance but cannot touch bias, and here the single-window subspace error is bias/drift-dominated, not variance-dominated. The higher-k, longer-L, lower-stability corner is where drift dominates most, and that's precisely where the harm concentrates.
- **This resolves the prereg's alternative hypothesis in the affirmative and redirects step 4.** Target-free variance reduction is INSUFFICIENT on real S&P data: the subspace's error is drift, which averaging worsens. So the multifactor generalization cannot be pure subspace-averaging, it needs the BIAS-AWARE route: Avenue 3, the distributionally-robust SOCP that uses Kristen's Davis-Kahan / t₆ rotation bound as a per-factor trust weight (down-weighting exactly the drifting/low-gap factors rather than blindly smoothing them). The surviving constructive avenue is Avenue 3, not Avenue 2's averaging.
- **Kept for reuse:** the subspace-stability metric (k-th eigenvalue of the L-window projector mean) is a genuinely useful standalone diagnostic, it flags when a factor subspace is drifting vs merely noisy.
