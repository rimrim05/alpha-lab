## Decisive cell (large-cap, n_est=63, k=5)

- (i) within-subspace rotation median CV: 0.0138 (≤0.02? YES), realized vol invariant to the frame
- (ii) rand-subspace control median rel excess: +0.26 (≥0.25? YES), vol depends on P (test has power)
- (iii) pure-projector rel gap vs full: +0.019 (≤0.10? YES), leading-order term near-sufficient
- (context) flat-Λ rel gap vs full: -0.007; λ₁/λ₅ = 9

## Verdict (pre-committed rule): **SUBSPACE FUNCTIONAL CONFIRMED**

## Story

- **The algebra holds on real data.** The pure-projector portfolio w ∝ (I−P)1 (which uses NOTHING but the span of the top-5 PCA factors: no eigenvalues, no individual eigenvector identities) lands within 1.9% realized vol of full min-var. A random within-subspace rotation of the frame moves realized vol by only 1.4% (CV), versus a 26% penalty for using the wrong subspace, an ~19x separation. Min-var is a subspace functional; the individual factor directions inside the span are irrelevant to the portfolio.
- **This survives S&P λ-heterogeneity** (λ₁/λ₅ ≈ 9 on large-cap: dominant market factor, the exact stress F-028/F-029 flagged). The memo's worry that the O(δ²/λ₅) term could break the approximation does not materialize at n=63 large-cap, flat-Λ is even marginally better than full (−0.7%, within noise). The gap grows modestly on small-cap / higher k (proj up to ~11%), so the fully precise statement is 'subspace + a little eigenvalue weighting', not 'projector alone always', but the frame identity is irrelevant everywhere (rot CV 1–3%).
- **What this settles for step 4.** The unrecoverable in-subspace rotation, Theorem 1's hard term, the object of Kristen's Davis–Kahan / t₆ assignment, is HARMLESS to minimum-variance portfolios. So the multifactor generalization should NOT try to correct individual eigenvectors (impossible, and unnecessary); it should estimate/de-bias the SUBSPACE PROJECTOR and the eigenvalues. This is real-data backing for Avenue 2 and reframes the open problem from 'fix the frame' to 'get the subspace right', the tractable version. Bring to Alex/Lisa.
- **Scope (honest):** confirmed for UNCONSTRAINED min-var (the exact object the algebra describes; long-only breaks the clean Σ⁻¹1 identity and is deferred to a follow-up). Next constructive step: the subspace-averaging estimator (variance-reduce P̂ across windows, target-free) and the Avenue-3 SOCP (rotation bound as per-factor trust), each a new prereg.
