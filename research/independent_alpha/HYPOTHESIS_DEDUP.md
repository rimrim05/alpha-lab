# HYPOTHESIS_DEDUP.md — 24 candidate hypotheses vs the frozen research record

*Agent 2 (Dedup) · Independent-Alpha program · 2026-07-10*

Method: each candidate checked against `research/hunt2026/FAILURES.md` (F-001..F-021, NR-1..5),
`RESEARCH_OBJECTS.md`, `TRIAL_LEDGER.md`, `robustness/*.md`, `estimator_lab/{RESULTS,CROSSOVER}.md`,
the four live pre-registrations (`exp-ic-earnings-fwd`, `ops-reality`, `est-crossover`, `defensive-asset`),
`ALPHA_SOURCE_REGISTRY.md` (AS-01..15), `research/director/EXPERIMENT_QUEUE.md` (11 ranked + audit),
and against the other 23 candidates. Where a doc contradicted code/ledgers, code/ledgers won.

**Recommendation legend:** APPROVE (new source, register + queue) · REOPEN (a FAILURES reopen
condition is explicitly satisfied) · REJECT_DUPLICATE (same source already registered or another
candidate) · REJECT_PARAM (parameter variant of a settled test) · NEEDS_DIFF (distinct but overlaps
a docketed item; must report the delta vs it).

## Non-trivial calls (justification)

**H-E2 REJECT_DUPLICATE.** H-E2 and HYP-A4-03-lowcov are the *same* Hong-Lim-Stein hypothesis
(PEAD strengthens as analyst coverage falls), same information (PIT earnings surprise × per-name
coverage count), same 20d horizon, same failure condition (low-minus-high coverage IC diff, interaction
t≥2, n≥600). They differ only in framing lane. Kept HYP-A4-03 as canonical because it names the
**free** coverage feed (Finnhub `stock/recommendation` count-sum), making it testable a quarter sooner
than H-E2's I/B/E/S / premium-endpoint path. One pre-registration, not two.

**Two sanctioned FAILURES reopens (near-zero research overhead, the F-021/F-006 pattern).**
- **H-E1** satisfies NR-1 verbatim: *"vol-conditioned entry timing remains the one untested angle"*
  (Dai et al. NBER w30917), and `ic_screen.md`'s verdict explicitly sanctions *"an interaction
  hypothesis with a mechanism"* as the one open door. All data on disk. This is the cheapest,
  highest-info reopen in the whole batch. Caveat carried forward: even a confirmed conditional IC is
  **level-1 predictive only**: tradability stays gated behind NR-1's cost wall (≤2-3 bps/side or
  intraday), so it is a signal-space object, never promoted straight to a book.
- **H-E4** satisfies F-016's named reopen ("interaction conditioning (momentum × … earnings)"). Needs
  PIT earnings-surprise sign; the `earnings-fwd` collector is already accruing, so the data pipeline
  exists: only depth is missing. Forward-collect, do not backfill (yfinance cache is survivorship-biased).
- **H-FF-01** satisfies F-005's named reopen ("tested on S&P 600 adds … needs survivorship-safe data").
  Reopen is legitimate but **data-blocked**: the repo has no PIT 600/400 membership and no
  delisted-inclusive small-cap price panel. Reopen ≠ testable now.

**H-C-sbcorr / H-cov-temporal-smooth NEEDS_DIFF (distinct but adjacent).**
- H-C-sbcorr's correlation signal is genuinely new, but `dual_momentum_gold` *already* momentum-picks
  TLT vs BIL and so partially captures bond-hedge failure in rising-rate regimes (its own MECHANISM
  cites 2013/2018). Its own failure condition already says it must beat that leg. Honest classification
  stands: **Portfolio/Estimator**, not an independent market forecast; score it as a hedge (NR-5), never
  as additive alpha.
- H-cov-temporal-smooth is distinct from queue #4 (post-optimization no-trade *band* clips weights off
  the frontier) and #5 (EWMA reweights *within* a window for recency, opposite objective). But all three
  attack turnover on the same min-var harness; it must be run reporting the paired delta vs #4 and #5,
  or it re-measures a docketed lever.

**Nothing else is a duplicate or parameter variant.** The four Lane-F estimator hypotheses are four
distinct levers (shrinkage-target / moment-robustness / residual-diagonal / temporal-path): none
touches the same layer as another, and none re-runs the settled JSE/MP/PCA eigenspectrum question
(F-010/F-021 closed). The three Lane-D execution hypotheses are three distinct fill-time levers, all
distinct from queue #2's session-attribution question. The Lane-A/-B new-information and forced-flow
sources have **no** prior test in the repo (no PIT earnings-revision, revenue, coverage, dispersion,
IPO, SEO, Russell, or small-cap index data exists, confirmed against DATA_GAP_MAP.md and the panels).

## Disposition summary

- **APPROVE (new source): 12** = A4-01, A4-02, A4-03, A4-04, FF-02, FF-03, FF-04, C-carry, C-value,
  C-breakeven, D1, D2, D3, D4(park), E3. *(15 including the two NEEDS_DIFF and the park.)*
- **REOPEN (sanctioned): 3** = H-FF-01 (F-005, data-blocked), H-E1 (NR-1, testable now), H-E4 (F-016, forward-collect).
- **NEEDS_DIFF: 2** = H-C-sbcorr, H-cov-temporal-smooth.
- **REJECT_DUPLICATE: 1** = H-E2 (→ HYP-A4-03-lowcov).
- **REJECT_PARAM: 0.**

**Survivors carried to HYPOTHESIS_QUEUE.md: 23** (all but H-E2). Of these, **10 are testable now**
(data_available_now=true): H-C-sbcorr, H-C-value, H-D1, H-D2, H-D3, H-E1, H-lw-target, H-robust-cov,
H-idio-shrink, H-cov-temporal-smooth. The other 13 require forward-collection or a data build and are
heavily discounted in the experiment ranking.
