# Pre-registration template — fill this in BEFORE running anything

Every experiment gets a copy of the block below, committed before the first scoring run.
No block, no run. Rationale: the trial ledger can only deflate what it can count
(TRIAL_LEDGER.md, "Rules going forward"), and a hypothesis stated after seeing the result
is a description, not a prediction.

Rules:
1. Commit the filled block (and the TRIAL_LEDGER.md row) before touching holdout or
   walk-forward data. Train-data exploration is allowed first; say so in the hypothesis.
2. One layer per experiment (A-D per RESEARCH_OBJECTS.md) against a registered baseline.
3. If the design was influenced by any prior out-of-sample result, flag it — that makes
   the hunt an adaptive loop and it must say so in its hunt-level ledger row.
4. The kill condition must be decidable from numbers the harness already emits.
5. Results get appended to the same block after the run: pass → CONFIDENCE_LADDER.md
   placement; fail → FAILURES.md entry. Either way the block is never edited above the
   Result line.

### EXP-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>

**Hypothesis** (one falsifiable sentence, mechanism included):

**Layer touched** (exactly one — A economic / B estimator / C portfolio / D execution,
per RESEARCH_OBJECTS.md) + registered baseline it is compared against:

**Alpha type tag**: market | estimator | portfolio | execution

**Expected result** (numeric, on which evaluator — blind holdout / walk-forward /
matched-pair delta):

**Alternative result** (what the world looks like if the hypothesis is false — what
number would the null produce?):

**Failure / kill condition** (pre-committed; decidable from harness output; includes
the "stop iterating" rule, not just the "this run failed" rule):

**Trial-ledger row**: TRIAL_LEDGER.md #__ (added in the same commit)

**Derived from prior holdout results?** yes/no — if yes, which, and note the adaptive
loop in the hunt-level table.

---
**Result** (filled after the run, never edited): pass/fail vs kill condition, one line,
link to FAILURES.md entry or CONFIDENCE_LADDER.md placement.

## Currently pre-registered (from RESEARCH_OBJECTS.md, open layer experiments)

| exp | layer | tag | one-liner |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~JSE k=3-5 unconstrained min-var, walk-forward~~ | B | estimator | **ANSWERED — do not re-run** (queue row predated the answers landing later on 2026-07-10): F-021 (n=252, k=1/3/5 unconstrained: JSE worse, t≈8-12) + its n=63 resolution (unconstrained still worse, t>6) + est-crossover (worse at every n=42..252, no crossover, F-021 CLOSED). Final rule: JSE always-on long-only / never unconstrained (estimator_lab/CROSSOVER.md) |
| ~~open+close execution in harness~~ | D | execution | **RUN 2026-07-14 — closed**: premium real (75% share both ETFs) but NOT exploitable — loses to buy-hold even gross, break-even cost negative; F-006 CLOSED FINALLY (F-025; preregistrations/open-close-2026-07-14.md) |
| ~~turnover-penalty (no-trade band) sweep, vol-managed family~~ | C | portfolio | **RUN 2026-07-14 — closed**: MIXED per rule, mechanism NOT supported (deltas were timing noise, 5-10x the cost saved; no adoptable band; preregistrations/turnover-band-2026-07-14.md) |
| ~~EWMA vs realized-window vol inside vol_managed_qqq~~ | B | estimator | **RUN 2026-07-14 — closed**: REALIZED BETTER decisively (matched pair −63.6 bps / 35% win share; ghost-vol cliff is a feature; F-024; preregistrations/ewma-vol-2026-07-14.md) |

Each remaining open row still needs its own filled template block before running.
