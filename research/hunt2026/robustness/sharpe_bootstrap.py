"""Path-luck robustness: block-bootstrap Sharpe intervals for the 7 live books.

Diagnostic on FROZEN specs over each book's own blind-evidence window (agent6 redteam
convention): round-1 books on the holdout year (start=META["cut"]), round-2 books on the
blind 5y window (start=2021-07-10). No spec, param, or panel change; all 7 books reported,
none selected. Baseline gate: the recomputed Sharpe must reproduce the published
results/results5y number (tol 0.01) before the bootstrap counts.

Writes robustness/sharpe_bootstrap.md + artifacts/hunt2026/sharpe_bootstrap_run.json.
