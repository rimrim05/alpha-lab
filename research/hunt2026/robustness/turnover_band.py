"""EXP-2026-07-14-turnover-band: portfolio-level no-trade band on the vol-managed family.

Specs untouched: the band is an overlay on the frozen spec's raw target rows (before
harness.run's gross-cap): adopt the new row only when L1 drift > band, else re-emit the
last-adopted row. 12 registered variants (6 bands x 2 books), all reported.

Gates before any variant counts (preregistrations/turnover-band-2026-07-14.md):
(a) band=0 THROUGH the filter reproduces the frozen spec's net series exactly;
(b) recomputed holdout Sharpe matches the published results JSON (tol 0.01).

Writes robustness/turnover_band.md + artifacts/hunt2026/turnover_band_run.json.
