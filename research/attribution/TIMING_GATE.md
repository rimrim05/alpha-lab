# TM timing gate — EXP-2026-07-14-timing-tm

Prereg: timing-tm-2026-07-14.md (frozen incl. dispositions 1–9). M2T = M2 + γ·(Mkt−RF)². Blind windows claim-bearing; as-frozen panel (F1 defect inherited, disclosed). NW lag 5 primary; lag-21 and stationary-bootstrap columns are disclosure.

## Gate verdict: **CONTROL-FAIL (see adjudication)**
- timing-positive books: 0/7 (strong tier, 5y books only: 0)
- control adjudications: [('CTRL_qqq_1.5x_static', 'blind_1y', np.float64(-2.8970620225510664), 1.0)]

## Notes (story, post-run)

**Verdict NOT SUPPORTED, overdetermined.** Two independent routes give the same answer:
(a) 0/7 books pass the timing-positive conjunction; (b) the pre-committed control
adjudication (disposition 6) fired: CTRL_qqq_1.5x_static blind-1y has t_γ = −2.90
with stationary-bootstrap p ≈ 1.0, i.e. a genuinely nonzero NEGATIVE γ on a static
book. Diagnosis: not pipeline plumbing and not beta asymmetry: the control's own
daily-rebalance cost term (cost ∝ |r|) is a concave drag, TM-visible at TV ≈ −0.07%/yr
(economically nil, statistically resolvable). Model limitation recorded; gate defaults
to NOT SUPPORTED, which the book results independently confirm.

Mechanism finding worth keeping: in the blind year the three flagged books show
SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE market convexity beyond M2 (vol_managed_qqq γ t −2.79,
vol_core_svxy −3.19, momentum_concentrated −2.08) offset by positive level α
(+14–15%/yr), netting to ≈ 0 after the financing haircut (−0.7%, −1.2%, −8.1%).
That is the short-gamma / premium-harvesting signature: the OPPOSITE of timing
convexity. The naive trend parent was itself whipsawed concave in the blind year
(γ −23, t −2.06). Books with positive γ (gem +0.72, defensive +0.81, gold +1.28)
are all deep inside noise.

Panel-state note (transparent deviation from disposition 9's wording): the gate ran on
the CORRECTED panel (post Memorial-Day phantom-row fix; n = 223/1,227, four more FF
days than the parent attribution's 219/1,223). Disposition 9 was drafted against the
audit's as-frozen assumption; the correction of record (TRIAL_LEDGER.md,
memos/panel-phantom-row-correction.md) and Kristen's program directive ("use corrected
panels for new analysis") supersede it. The books' frozen results were themselves
regenerated post-fix, so integrity is consistent.

Disclosure per disposition 5/6: CTRL_spy_buyhold blind-5y shows t_γ = +3.13 but its
stationary-bootstrap p fell inside (0.05, 0.95) → adjudicated as NW-size noise per the
pre-committed rule (the reviewer's Monte Carlo predicted exactly this ~2–3× size
distortion on squared regressors); γ = +0.48, TV +1.5%/yr, consistent with a small
SPY-vs-CRSP-market composition artifact. PIT-QQQRES robustness (disposition 8):
identical t_γ to two decimals for every book: the F2 look-ahead does not move γ.

Read the verdict against the MDE table: hunt-1 books could only have shown TV ≥
+11–19%/yr (implausibly large); the powered test is the 5y books, where TV ≥ +5.4%/yr
(defensive_ensemble) was detectable and nothing appeared. Scope: TM-visible timing
only: vol-space convexity, discrete Henriksson–Merton switching, and horizon-
mismatched timing are invisible to a single daily (Mkt−RF)² term by design.
