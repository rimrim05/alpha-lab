# # StatArb residual reversion: research notebook
#
# A market-neutral statistical-arbitrage strategy (Avellaneda–Lee residual reversion) taken through a
# full research workflow: reproduce, **attack** (survivorship audits), quantify which production layers
# matter (ablation), and ask whether a meta-model can predict *which* signals revert.
#
# **This notebook never re-runs the backtest.** It reads the artifacts the audited engine wrote
# (`artifacts/statarb/…`), the compute/present seam that keeps the headline number honest.
#
# *Paper trading only. Nothing here places real orders.*

# ## ⚠ Superseded: Stage-4 kill (2026-07-10)
#
# The results in this notebook were computed under the pre-fix engine, which scored P&L in
# **residual space** (`held x residual`). The trailing-alpha term that scoring credits is
# unhedgeable, and the implementable book (stock − lagged-beta x sector ETF) earns ~1.3%/yr gross
# against ~5.3%/yr of costs, net Sharpe **−0.88**, and **−1.06** after the pre-registered
# drift-corrected salvage. **Verdict: dead.** This notebook is kept as the historical record the
# post-mortem dissects: see `memos/diagnostics-2026-07-10.md` and the README.

# The single most important question in this notebook, up front: if instead of trading **every**
# residual signal we trade only those a meta-model rates likely to revert, does the book improve,
# **out of sample**? The threshold is pre-registered on earlier trades and reported on held-out later
# trades. Reported whichever way it comes out: a null result is itself a finding.

# `daily_sharpe` here is a daily Sharpe from the audited engine: sub-threshold signals are zeroed
# out of the positions matrix and run through the same `equal_weight_net` path as the headline
# backtest. The ungated held-out Sharpe anchors the comparison. Caveat: this is one
# pre-registered held-out split, not cross-validated, so read the lift as directional. Per-trade win
# rate and mean P&L are the complementary trade-level view.

# **Honest note.** QuantStats' Sharpe assumes a risk-free rate and its own periodization; the house
# scorecard uses rf=0, ddof=1. The two won't exactly match: a convention difference, not a bug. The
# custom deflated-Sharpe (Bailey–López de Prado) remains the multiple-testing guard QuantStats omits.

# ## The meta-model: walk-forward, leakage-safe

# Features are **entry-time only** (an exit-time feature like `holding_days` would leak the label).
# Expanding-window monthly training; out-of-fold AUC below.

# ## Limitations (stated, not buried)
#
# - **Survivorship.** The backward log is survivor-biased on deep-dip longs; the meta-model here is a
#   *prototype*. Its clean training set is the forward paper book (survivorship-immune by construction).
# - **Reconstruction.** The gated-vs-ungated `daily_sharpe` is from a sparse trade→daily reconstruction;
#   per-trade win rate / mean P&L are the trustworthy comparison.
# - **Costs & capacity.** Residual reversion is turnover-heavy and cost-sensitive; the ablation charges
#   costs explicitly, but real fills, borrow, and impact are not modeled here.
#
# ## Conclusion
#
# The strategy is real and its limits are named. The differentiator isn't the Sharpe, it's the
# discipline: survivorship audits, an ablation that says which layers earn their keep, and a
# leakage-safe meta-model reported whichever way it comes out.
