"""Agent 2 independent engine: NO imports from alpha-lab code.

Two engines, both written from the P&L convention in the harness docstring +
SPEC_CONVENTIONS.md (weights set at close t, earn close-to-close t+1, costs per
side on |dw|, gross capped at 2.0):

  weight_engine  : replicates the stated weight-space convention with an explicit
                   python loop (independent arithmetic check of harness.run).
  share_engine   : a real account, integer-free share-based sim. Holds shares,
                   trades at close t to reach target weights, pays costs on traded
                   notional, cash earns `cash_rate_daily`, levered financing charged
                   at `borrow_rate_daily` on borrowed cash. Marks to market daily.
                   NaN close => stale-price mark (last known price), which is what a
                   broker statement would show.

The gap between the two is the convention gap (free daily re-trueing, no financing,
dropped returns on NaN days). The gap inside weight_engine vs harness is a bug.
