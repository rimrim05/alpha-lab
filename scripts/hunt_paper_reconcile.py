"""EXP-OPS-REALITY (layer D): reconcile the hunt2026 paper books against the Alpaca PAPER account.

READ-ONLY vs the broker: this script only ever calls get_orders / get_all_positions; it never
submits, cancels, or modifies anything. It measures the gap between the frozen backtest execution
model (10 bps/side stocks, 2 bps/side ETFs, next-day fills, no rejects; research/hunt2026/
harness.py) and reality:

  per run-date: side-adjusted slippage per h26 fill vs that date's ledger reference close,
  rejected/zero-fill order counts, intended-vs-actual position gap, per-book slippage drag
  (fills pro-rated by each book's share of the aggregate target), silent-flat detection
  (nonzero targets, no fills, no position, 2+ consecutive nights -> alarm).

Agreement bands are pre-registered in research/hunt2026/preregistrations/ops-reality-2026-07-10.md;
one JSONL row per night appends to ledgers/hunt2026/_reconcile.jsonl.

Usage: .venv/bin/python scripts/hunt_paper_reconcile.py            # latest ledger date
       .venv/bin/python scripts/hunt_paper_reconcile.py --since 2026-07-10   # replay from date

Nightly wiring (Director-approved plist edit required, research agents may not alter
deployments): run this right after hunt_paper_run in com.rimrim.hunt2026-paper by making
ProgramArguments a shell line, i.e.
  /bin/zsh -c '.venv/bin/python scripts/hunt_paper_run.py --live;
               .venv/bin/python scripts/hunt_paper_reconcile.py'
An evening reconcile measures the PREVIOUS run-date's fills (they happen at today's open).
