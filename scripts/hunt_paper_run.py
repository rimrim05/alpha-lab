"""Nightly paper-book runner for the promoted hunt2026 books.

Seven books (fixed registry below), each a frozen hunt2026 spec. Every night: build a fresh
panel (panel_2005.parquet history + latest yfinance ETF bars), take each spec's target_weights
LAST row as tonight's target book, size it to an equal share (equity/7) of account equity, log a
ledger row (targets, fills, nav, both benchmark navs) per book, and, only with --live, submit.

Execution routing (cutover 2026-07-15, memos/mc-account-isolation-cutover-2026-07-15.md): the six
ETF books aggregate into the SHARED Alpaca paper account (ALPACA_*, tag h26); momentum_concentrated
executes ALONE in a DEDICATED paper account (ALPACA_MC_*, tag h26mc) so its single-stock fills,
marks, and survivorship are broker-attributable. Sizing is unchanged: divisor stays 7.

DEFAULT IS --dry-run: compute + print orders, write a ledger row marked "dry", submit NOTHING.
--live submits to Alpaca paper only (never real money). Do NOT run --live unattended before review.

Usage: .venv/bin/python scripts/hunt_paper_run.py --dry-run [--equity 100000]
       .venv/bin/python scripts/hunt_paper_run.py --live
