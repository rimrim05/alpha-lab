# Clean-Cycle Report — 2026-07-13 (populated baseline)

**Status:** POPULATED from broker + ledger evidence. **NOT a clean-start authorization.**
No `DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.md` edit in this session. First launchd fire still pending tonight 20:30 PT.

**How this was filled:** read-only Alpaca `get_account` / `get_all_positions` (snapshot
`2026-07-13T18:00:57-07:00`) + `ledgers/hunt2026/_reconcile.jsonl` latest row
(`run_at=2026-07-13T17:58:37`, session date still labeled `2026-07-10`) + launchctl print of
`com.rimrim.hunt2026-paper`. Template rules followed: no inferred fields; canceled ≠ rejected;
no alpha conclusions.

## 1. Cycle identification

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Broker session date (regular session being reconciled) | `2026-07-10` (ledger label) · live fills settled into Mon `2026-07-13` open | `_reconcile.jsonl` `date`; Alpaca fill settlement |
| Snapshot timestamp — pre-cycle baseline | `INCONCLUSIVE` — no committed pre-open snapshot artifact for Mon open | — |
| Snapshot timestamp — post-cycle | `2026-07-13T18:00:57-07:00` | live `get_*` |
| Scheduler run ID | `PENDING` — `nightly.log` absent; launchctl `runs=0`, `last exit code=(never exited)` | `artifacts/hunt2026/paper/`; `launchctl print gui/501/com.rimrim.hunt2026-paper` |
| Strategy / spec commit | `5c7e931a22c4a6f03df3ee06a6932922290d32c3` (repo HEAD at report time) | `git rev-parse HEAD` |
| Reconciliation-code commit | `a644decf532d09c93fe1a139c52843348361d399` | `git log -1 -- scripts/hunt_paper_reconcile.py` |
| Clean-start candidate timestamp | *(blank — §11 conditions not all met)* | — |

---

## 2. Pre-cycle baseline

Live broker snapshot at report time (no separate pre-open artifact). Cross-check: latest
`_reconcile.jsonl` foreign block.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Equity | `$99,239.91` | `get_account().equity` |
| Cash | `−$10,511.42` | `get_account().cash` |
| Buying power | `$263,857.79` | `get_account().buying_power` |
| Gross long | `$110,334.77` | Σ long MV |
| Gross short | `$583.44` | Σ \|short MV\| |
| Gross exposure (Σ\|mv\|) | `$110,918.21` | positions |
| Net exposure (Σ signed mv) | `$109,751.33` | positions |
| Foreign positions (count) | `0` | `_reconcile.jsonl` `foreign_positions.n` + live |
| Open flatten orders (count) | `0` | `get_orders(OPEN)` |
| Flatten quantity — submitted | `INCONCLUSIVE` (not stored on latest row as a scalar; historical Jul-10 notes cited 1,563) | — |
| Flatten quantity — filled | `INCONCLUSIVE` (same) | — |
| Flatten quantity — remaining | `0` | `foreign_positions.flatten_remaining_total` |

**Cash note (triage, not a flatten-gate input):** cash is negative because the book is leveraged long
(~1.12× gross / equity, multiplier=4). This is consistent with margin on a long ETF-heavy book, not
evidence of a cash-ledger bug. `last_equity=$100,790.64` → equity ≈ `$99,240` (Δ ≈ −$1,551 MTM since
prior mark). Leave as monitoring; do not treat as residual inventory.

---

## 3. Four-part flatten gate

| # | Gate | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foreign position count = 0 | **PASS** | `foreign_positions.n = 0`; live `foreign=0` |
| 2 | Remaining flatten quantity = 0 | **PASS** | `flatten_remaining_total = 0`; `flatten_complete = true` |
| 3 | No terminally failed flatten order attached to a nonzero foreign position | **PASS** | live `failed_flatten=false`; open orders=0; rejects=0 |
| 4 | Independent broker snapshot agrees with ledger on foreign/flatten | **PASS** | live foreign_n=0 matches reconcile foreign_n=0 (`paper_status` g4 PASS) |

**Overall flatten gate:** **COMPLETE** — foreign inventory cleared; live and ledger agree on foreign=0.

*(Separate from flatten: first **launchd** cycle has still never fired — see §9/§10.)*

---

## 4. Residual exception table

No **foreign** residuals. One **wrong-side / incomplete-book** exception (in-target, not foreign):

| Symbol | Signed qty | Side | Price | Signed MV | Order status | Submitted qty | Filled qty | Remaining qty | Asset status | Tradable | Probable cause | Manual-intervention recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AMAT | −1 | short | ~$584 | −$583.44 | none open | INCONCLUSIVE | INCONCLUSIVE | 1 share short vs long `$324.76` target | active | yes | Known Jul-10 held-for-orders residue; book target is long AMAT (`target_dollars.AMAT=324.76`) but broker still holds −1 | **Do not hand-trade.** Let tonight's `hunt_paper_run.py --live` net toward the aggregate target; re-check post-cycle. |

Also incomplete (in target, not held — contribute to gap, not foreign):
`AMD, CAT, DELL, FIX, GOOG, GOOGL, KLAC, LITE, MU, SNDK, STX, WDC` (12 names from
`momentum_concentrated` sleeve).

---

## 5. Seven-book target reconciliation

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Intended aggregate holdings (Σ target $) | `$100,794.35` notional | `_account.jsonl` last `notional` |
| Actual broker holdings (Σ held $) | `$110,918.21` gross \|MV\| | live positions |
| Position-gap fraction | `4.99%` | `_reconcile.jsonl` `position_gap_frac` |
| Missing target symbols (in target, not held) | `AMD, CAT, DELL, FIX, GOOG, GOOGL, KLAC, LITE, MU, SNDK, STX, WDC` | set diff |
| Foreign symbols (held, in no target) | none | `foreign_positions.symbols=[]` |
| Silent-flat books | none (`flat_nights=0` all 7) | `_reconcile.jsonl` `books[*]` |

**Reconcile sufficiently to begin the clean forward clock?** **NO** — flatten gate is COMPLETE, but
(1) first launchd cycle has not run (`nightly.log` absent, `runs=0`); (2) AMAT wrong-side residue + 12
missing target names keep `position_gap_frac=4.99%`; (3) council + governance require a clean
*automated* cycle before Coordinator manifest edit. Threshold judgment deferred to post-20:30
reconcile.

---

## 6. Order and fill summary

Source: latest `_reconcile.jsonl` for labeled session `2026-07-10` (re-measured `2026-07-13T17:58:37`).

| Outcome | Count | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Submitted | `304` | `n_orders` |
| Broker accepted | `304` | fills=orders, rejects=0 |
| Filled | `304` | `n_fills` |
| Partial | `0` | `n_partial` |
| Canceled | `0` | `n_canceled` |
| Rejected | `0` | `n_rejects` |
| Expired | `0` | — |
| Replaced | `0` | `n_replaced` |
| Still open | `0` | live `get_orders(OPEN)` |

---

## 7. Slippage

| Metric | ETF | Stock |
|---|---|---|
| Fill count | `16` | `17` |
| Median (bps) | `−17.48` | `+40.04` |
| Mean (bps) | `−25.22` | `+61.9` |
| Notional-weighted mean (bps) | not in row | not in row |
| 95th percentile (bps) | not in row | not in row |
| Worst fill (bps, symbol) | not in row | not in row |
| % within frozen assumption | not in row | not in row |

- **Reference-price definition:** reconcile run-date reference close (script default).
- **Fills excluded:** not enumerated on row.
- **Sample sufficiency:** **\<20 per class → interpretation WITHHELD.** Means are outside the
  provisional bands printed by reconcile (ETF 0–5 bps, stock 0–15 bps) but `n<20` — log as
  monitoring for the second data point after tonight; do not retune bands.

---

## 8. Account changes

No committed pre-open baseline row with broker equity/cash. Partial marks only:

| Metric | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Equity | `$100,790.64` (`last_equity`) | `$99,239.91` | ≈ `−$1,551` |
| Buying power | INCONCLUSIVE | `$263,857.79` | — |
| Cash | INCONCLUSIVE | `−$10,511.42` | — |
| Gross exposure | INCONCLUSIVE | `$110,918.21` | — |
| Net exposure | INCONCLUSIVE | `$109,751.33` | — |

| Derived | Value | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Realized transition P&L | INCONCLUSIVE | no cash-flow-adjusted baseline |
| Estimated flatten costs | INCONCLUSIVE | slippage sample too thin |
| Unattributed residual | INCONCLUSIVE | — |

---

## 9. Contamination assessment

| Source | Affected? | Evidence / note |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy inventory (stat-arb residue) | **NO** (foreign) / **PARTIAL** (AMAT −1 wrong-side) | §3 PASS; §4 AMAT exception |
| Flatten costs | YES (present, magnitude withheld) | §7 n\<20 |
| Order netting (cross-book) | YES (by design) | aggregate `h26-*` submission |
| Stale data | NO evidence | — |
| Rejected or partial orders | NO | §6 zeros |
| Corporate actions | INCONCLUSIVE | not audited this session |
| Broker or scheduler failures | **YES — scheduler never fired** | `nightly.log` absent; launchctl `runs=0` |

**Material contamination remaining?** **YES (operational)** — automated scheduler path unproven;
AMAT wrong-side share + incomplete momentum sleeve. Foreign stat-arb inventory: **cleared**.

---

## 10. Readiness verdict

- [ ] TRANSITION INCOMPLETE
- [x] OPERATIONAL CYCLE PASSED, CLEAN CLOCK NOT STARTED
- [ ] CLEAN FORWARD INCUBATION STARTED
- [ ] MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED

**Verdict:** OPERATIONAL CYCLE PASSED, CLEAN CLOCK NOT STARTED

**Exact reason:** §3 four-part flatten gate COMPLETE on live+ledger evidence; §5 gap/AMAT/missing
targets and §9 unproven launchd path block §11 clean-start. Do not record a clean-start timestamp
until tonight's first automated cycle reconciles cleanly.

---

## 11. Clean forward start

- **Clean-start timestamp:** *(BLANK)*
- **Conditions met:** §3 COMPLETE · §5 NO · §9 material contamination YES (scheduler + AMAT)
- **Note:** recording a timestamp here would still NOT edit the manifest. Manifest update remains a
  separate Coordinator action after Kristen approves this report **and** the post-20:30 cycle.

---

## 12. Next action

**Next action:** Keep the machine awake through 20:30 PT; let `com.rimrim.hunt2026-paper` fire
unattended; after `nightly.log` shows a completed run, re-run `scripts/paper_status.py` (+ reconcile
if the job's trailing reconcile step failed), then amend this report with the first automated-cycle
section and only then submit a clean-start manifest edit for Kristen approval.

### Pre-flight already done this session (do not redo)
1. Reconcile refreshed (`foreign=0`, gap `4.99%`, 304/304 fills) — appended `_reconcile.jsonl`.
2. launchd loaded; weekdays 20:30; cwd + `.venv` paths correct; log dir writable; no pid/lock files.
3. `pmset`: system sleep enabled (`sleep 1`) but currently prevented by active apps — **do not close
   lid / force sleep before 20:30.**
4. No manual `hunt_paper_run.py --live` (council: leave alone until scheduled fire).

### Hard stops (do not proceed to clean clock)
- `nightly.log` still absent 15+ min after 20:30
- foreign \> 0 after cycle
- rejects \> 0 or unexpected open orders
- unexplained gap jump
- hand-trading AMAT or missing sleeve names

*Populated 2026-07-13 ~18:01 PT. Council transcript:
`runtime/council/2026-07-14T01-00-18-697Z-537bf159.md` (vault). Codex seat was offline
(`spawn codex ENOENT`); Claude + Cursor only.*

## 13. Amendment — first automated cycle + Kristen approval (2026-07-14)

**The §9/§10 blocker "launchd never fired" is now CLEARED.** The first scheduled cycle ran
unattended:

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| launchd runs / last exit | `runs=2`, `exit 0` | `launchctl print gui/501/com.rimrim.hunt2026-paper` |
| Reconcile timestamp (automated) | `2026-07-13T20:31:51` | `_reconcile.jsonl` latest row |
| Orders / fills / rejects / partial | `304 / 304 / 0 / 0` | reconcile row |
| Flatten gate | `4/4 PASS` (foreign=0, remaining=0, no failed flatten, broker==ledger) | `paper_status.py` §3 |
| Silent-flat books / alarms | `0 / 0` | reconcile row |

**Still blocking a clean-start (unchanged from §5, NOT resolved by the automated cycle):**
- **AMAT wrong-side −1** (Jul-10 held-for-orders residue) did **not** net to its long target on the
  automated cycle — still short 1 share vs a long target.
- **position_gap_frac WIDENED** `4.99% → 5.77%` (moved the wrong direction).

**Amended readiness verdict:** still **OPERATIONAL CYCLE PASSED, CLEAN CLOCK NOT STARTED** — but the
reason narrows from "scheduler unproven + gap/AMAT" to **"gap/AMAT only."** The automated path is now
proven.

**Approval (Kristen, 2026-07-14):** **APPROVED** as an operational-cycle-passed status record.
Scope of this approval, explicit:
- It **does NOT** start the clean-forward clock (§11 timestamp stays **BLANK** — AMAT + gap unresolved).
- It **does NOT** authorize a `DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.md` edit (that remains a separate Coordinator action).
- Starting the clock requires a **subsequent cycle that nets AMAT to its long target and brings the gap
  back down**, then a fresh amendment here + the Coordinator manifest edit.

*Amended 2026-07-14 by Claude on Kristen's instruction; automated-cycle evidence from this session's
`paper_status.py` / `launchctl` / `_reconcile.jsonl` reads.*
