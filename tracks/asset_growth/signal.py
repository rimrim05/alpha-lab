"""Asset-growth contrarian signal (Cooper, Gulen & Schill 2008).

Year-over-year total-asset growth is a CONTRARIAN cross-sectional signal: low-asset-
growth firms outperform high-growth firms (~20%/yr spread in the paper). So the score
is the NEGATIVE of asset growth: low growth ranks high (long), high growth ranks low
(short). Low turnover (annual), so it survives costs (Novy-Marx & Velikov).

Directly answers the "does highest YoY growth predict returns" question: it predicts
NEGATIVE returns — see [[LIT — Does highest YoY growth predict returns]].
