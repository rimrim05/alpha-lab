"""Today's target book: the live signal, reusing the backtest math verbatim.

`rolling_residual` + `band_positions` are imported UNCHANGED from the backtest, so
the live book is the backtest book by construction (the parity harness, added
before go-live, proves it bit-for-bit). Given a trailing daily price panel and the
matched factor returns, emit today's target: one signed equal-weight row per active
name, tagged with the s-score bucket the floored-premium resolver keys on.
