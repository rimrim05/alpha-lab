"""Terminal-event disambiguation: the survivorship SENSOR (highest-risk unit).

A false `delisted` injects a fake dead-name loss and *manufactures* the very signal
we're testing for, so every rule here is conservative and ambiguity NEVER
auto-books a dead-name loss (→ quarantine, flagged for human review). See the
disambiguation table in the spec; this is that table as code.

`classify` returns (reason, keep): keep=True means mark-to-last, do NOT book a
close (the position survives to the next run).
