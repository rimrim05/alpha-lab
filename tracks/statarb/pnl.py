"""The audited equal-weight, dollar-neutral, net-of-cost P&L series.

This is the single P&L formula behind the headline backtest result. Both the backtest
(`run_residual`) and the ML-gated backtest call it, so a gated book's Sharpe comes from the same
code path as the headline number, not a reconstruction. `rets` must be the IMPLEMENTABLE return
matrix (see tracks/statarb/residual.hedged_returns); scoring on the residual itself would credit
the book with the unhedgeable trailing-alpha term (2026-07-10 engine fix).
